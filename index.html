        The story begins with Yan's determination to find deer. He returns to a trail he had previously explored, this time encountering numerous fresh tracks that initially confuse him. <br>
        Yan follows the freshest tracks, leading to his first sighting of two deer. <br>
        He's awestruck by their appearance and behaviour, noting how they seem to look with both their eyes and ears. <br>
        Yan observes the deer playing, bounding up and down effortlessly. <br>
        After the deer leave, Yan examines their tracks. He's amazed to discover the incredible distance between each set of tracks, realising the deer's bounds cover 18 to 30 feet at a time.  <br>
        Yan concludes that the deer don't run, but essentially fly, only touching the ground occasionally. He expresses gladness that the deer escaped, recognising the unique nature of his observation. <br>

      ðŸ‘‰ <b>The middle part of the story:</b> The middle part of a story is where the plot unfolds, and the character usually faces challenges or obstacles. It is where tension builds, leading up to the climax. This part of the story often includes new discoveries or complications that make the journey more exciting for both the character and the reader.
      <br><br>
      ðŸ‘‰ <b> Symbolism:</b> Symbolism is like a secret code in stories. It's when an author uses one thing to represent or stand for something else, often a bigger idea or feeling.
      <br><br>
      ðŸ‘‰ <b>Emotional Tone:</b> Emotional tone is the feeling or mood the author creates in a story. It helps readers connect with the emotions of the characters and understand the atmosphere of the scene.
      <br><br>
      ðŸ‘‰ <b>Conclusion:</b> The conclusion is the ending of the story where things are wrapped up. It provides a sense of closure and often reveals what the character has learned or how they have changed. Itâ€™s the final part that gives meaning to the events of the story.
